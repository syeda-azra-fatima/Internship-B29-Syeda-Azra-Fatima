
learned about pastecs library ,this library helps in runing stat.desc on dataframe which gives 
overall statistic values of each variables.

 
library(pastecs)
stat.desc(mydata)


dummy sample code
>Salesdummy <- dummyVars(~., data = Sales, levelsOnly = TRUE)
>Sdummy <- predict(Salesdummy, Sales)

week2: work on knowledge gaining about multilevel target algorithms preprocess 
techniques and possible data claning techniques.

week 3: fitted Random forest model on dataset first with smoting and another time 
without smoting ,got similar predictions both the time after running confusion matrix .

tried applying multinomail logistic regression , got wierd readings on summarizing the
 LR 

Deviance Residuals: 
       Min          1Q      Median          3Q         Max  
-2.107e-08  -2.107e-08   2.107e-08   2.107e-08   2.107e-08  

Coefficients: (8 not defined because of singularities)

After spending considerable amount of time on R&D about the reading droped the model.
